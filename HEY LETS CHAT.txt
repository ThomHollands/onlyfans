Hey, I really like that you mapped out OF's revenue.
I'm building a community around OnlyFans, and am going after the 5% referrals, 
and would like you to join me.

I've contacted 5 content creators on OF, asked them a series of questions to gain a better
understanding of the finances, business issues with new content creators, and how to solve them.

One thing that your model is missing, is PPV messages.
Obviously, I only have a few data points, BUT apparently,
most of the more known content creators, like famous creators, make the majority of their money off the PPV messages.
If you're unfamiliar, they're video messages with a filter over the video. If you *click* it,
your account is charged the cost of the video. Only value point I have is that of a video costing $15.
It's my understanding that on a professional level, this is automated. Sending 4 videos a month would
dramatically increase the value.

Also, I'm watching Amber's recuritment (Lead Recruiter at OnlyFans).
I have the metrics of the people she's bringing over (It's on her OF blog).
She's targeting people with > 34k followers on IG.
I believe there's a massive gap between new content creators, and influencers joining.

Just a few things to consider. I'd like to talk to you more on this.
Hope we can connect. Let's chat.
